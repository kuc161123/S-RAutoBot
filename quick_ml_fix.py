QUICK FIX: Stop ML from learning false data
Run this to apply a temporary fix
"""

print("""
=====================================
ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
=====================================

THE PROBLEM:
ML is recording OPEN trades as "completed" with fake outcomes.
This ruins the ML model with false data.

QUICK FIX (Do this NOW):
========================

1. STOP THE BOT
   Ctrl+C to stop live_bot.py

2. RESET ML DATA
   Run: python3 reset_all_stats.py
   Type: RESET
   
3. DISABLE ML TEMPORARILY
   Edit config.yaml:
   
   trade:
     use_ml_scoring: false  # <- Change to false
   
4. RESTART BOT
   python3 live_bot.py
   
This will:
- Stop ML from learning false data
- Clear the corrupted data
- Let bot trade WITHOUT ML scoring
- Use only the pullback strategy rules

BETTER SOLUTION (After stopping bleeding):
==========================================
We need to fix check_closed_positions() in live_bot.py
to only record trades that ACTUALLY hit TP or SL.

Current bug: It's checking if symbol is in exchange positions,
but this check is failing and marking open trades as closed.

Would you like me to:
A) Apply the quick fix above first (recommended)
B) Fix the code properly in live_bot.py
C) Both - quick fix now, proper fix after
